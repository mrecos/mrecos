### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Matt and I write code, do analysis, and build spatial data prodcuts. I do this for work at SafeGraph which is am amazing data startup providin high quality data about the built environment. I am also an Adjust Professor in the PENN MUSA program where the best and brightest learn how to use spatial data and R to make the world a more equitable and place.

Some of the things I have been working on:

- ðŸ”­ Currently working on some interesting PCA featurization stuff for an upcoming presentation
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently sharpening my skills in Scala, Sedona, and Python
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about R or using Data Science in the Engineering & Construction Industries or generally about spatial data!
