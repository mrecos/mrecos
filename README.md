### Hi there 👋
My name is Matt and I write code, think a lot, and build spatial data prodcuts. I am an Adjust Professor in the PENN MUSA program where the best and brightest learn how to use spatial data and R to make the world a more equitable and place.

Some of the things I have been working on:

- 🔭 Currently working on some interesting PCA featurization stuff for an upcoming presentation
- 🌱 I’m currently sharpening my skills in Scala, Sedona, and Python
- 💬 Ask me about R or using Data Science for spatial data!
- 📫 How to reach me: matthew.harris@micadatalabs.com or md_harris on Twitter
- 🕸️ Check out some older, but interesting work in my blog: https://matthewdharris.com/
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him, they/them

⚡ Fun fact: I once made it to the regional finals in Super Marios Brothers 2 World Championship!
