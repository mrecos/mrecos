### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Matt and I write code, think a lot, and build spatial data prodcuts. I am an Adjust Professor in the PENN MUSA program where the best and brightest learn how to use spatial data and R to make the world a more equitable and place.

Some of the things I have been working on:

- ðŸ”­ Currently working on some interesting PCA featurization stuff for an upcoming presentation
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently sharpening my skills in Scala, Sedona, and Python
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about R or using Data Science for spatial data!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: matthew.harris@micadatalabs.com or md_harris on Twitter
- :web: Check out some older, but interesting work in my blog: https://matthewdharris.com/
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him, they/them

âš¡ Fun fact: I once made it to the regional finals in Super Marios Brothers 2 World Championship!
