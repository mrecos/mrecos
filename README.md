### Hi there ğŸ‘‹
My name is Matt and I write code, do analysis, and build spatial data prodcuts. I am an Adjust Professor in the PENN MUSA program where the best and brightest learn how to use spatial data and R to make the world a more equitable and place.

Some of the things I have been working on:

- ğŸ”­ Currently working on some interesting PCA featurization stuff for an upcoming presentation
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently sharpening my skills in Scala, Sedona, and Python
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about R or using Data Science for spatial data!
